# Advent of Code 2021
Advent of code is a yearly programming [puzzle challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about). 

This is my first year participating, and I'm looking to learn Common Lisp.

I'm keeping things as simple as possible, so no definition of systems or packages.
Each file will contain the solution for the day's challange.

## Requirements
- A Common Lisp installation, [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org) for example

## Running
To run a particular day, such as 01.lisp, you can use the following commands:
```
cd src
sbcl --script 01.lisp
```
